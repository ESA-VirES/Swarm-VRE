System specification
====================

As this is a freely provided service, the per-user "hardware" available is limited. These are the minimum guaranteed resources available:

 - 1 CPU
 - 1GB RAM
 - 2GB storage

In reality you will typically have more available, depending on the load on the system - currently this is flexible up to 8GB RAM. These limits are subject to change.

This should be enough to access and plot data from VirES (or indeed other services) and do small analyses, but obviously will be a problem for computationally demanding or large data tasks.

If you have a reasonable use case, the limits can be raised on an individual basis (:doc:`contact us <help>`).
