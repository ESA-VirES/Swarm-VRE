System specification
====================

As this is a freely provided service, the per-user "hardware" available is limited. The limits are subject to change, but at time of writing they are:

 - 1 CPU
 - 3.5GB RAM
 - 10GB persistent storage

This should be enough to access and plot data from VirES (or indeed other services) and do small analyses, but obviously will be a problem for computationally demanding or large data tasks.

If you have a reasonable use case, we may be able to raise the limits on a temporary or individual basis :doc:`(contact us) <help>`.
