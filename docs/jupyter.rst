About Jupyter
=============

This page provides guidance regarding the use of Jupyter.

Terminology
-----------

Jupyter can be confusing! So here is a handy list of terms:

Project Jupyter
  The broader open source project and community.

Jupyter Notebook
  A notebook document (file extension .ipynb) is a document that can be rendered in a web browser that can contain text, mathematics, images, *live code*, and other interactive elements. "Jupyter Notebook" can also refer to the web application that enables notebooks to build and run such notebooks.

JupterLab
  This is the evolution of the Jupyter Notebook software providing a richer interface. It is the default interface for the VRE when you first login.

JupyterHub
  This software runs on servers to provide a multi-user system which automatically spawns and manages instances of JupyterLab/Notebook

Jupyter kernel
  When used with reference to Jupyter, a "kernel" refers to the program which executes code cells within a notebook. Only one kernel at a time can be connected to a notebook. In the VRE we currently provide two kernels: Python 3.7 (with a number of packages installed), and Octave.
